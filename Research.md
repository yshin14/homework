During the mid critique, I made statement about the future we think of wouldn't be exactly we think of. Basic logic of next industrial revolution is based on computer data. But as we know, data containing systems today isn't perfect. They could lose their data by mistake, or as time goes on. This picture is actually landscape. But I made it purposly to lose data and recover data based on already lost data.

I think picture is literal visual explanation of computer data. So I choosed to do with images.
