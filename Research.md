As I was researching about current and future industrial revolution, I found out the "data" plays major role. Converting the object from real life to data form. Even data is saved through cloud system, but what makes cloud systems are physical objects. This objects called Hard Drive, and some times Solid State Drive. These object is very fragile, as time passes data could be corrupted. When data is corrupted, they recovers data with algebraic expression. But sometimes A.I are used. If future is depends on computer "data", than data saving mechanism has to be indepedent. But the system isn't perfect to be independent. Not many people aware of this. So I created visual representation of corrupted data of a image and let it printed as a paper since paper is independent systems. I titled this work as "Declaration of independent", because the "data" in this case wants to be independent system so other system to be depend on it.
