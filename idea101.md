# Self-Driving Cars

The concepts of the Self-Driving Cars goes back to exhibition at 1939 New York World's Fair. General Motors displayed how World would be looks like in 20 years. Although it wasn't Self-Driving Cars on regular street, it was more like Self-Driving Cars on specially made track for Self-Driving Cars.

In 1977 Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory developed automated car.  It was simple idea. Putting the camera each side of cars (total two camera) and tracks white street markers and used computer to process the signal. But speed of cars only goes up to 19 miles per hour. However, after decade later, using Germans improved camera, it improved speed of the car up to 56 miles per hour.

There is different type of levels for the Self-Driving Cars.

##### Level 0:
The automated system has no control over the vehicle, but may prompt the driver of hazards

##### Level 1:
The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples of this can be found in most cars equipped with ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems)

##### Level 2:
The automated system is capable of taking full control of the vehicle; however, the driver must be ready to intervene if the system fails to recognize a potential hazard

##### Level 3:
The Automated system takes full control of the vehicle and the passenger can safely take their attention away from driving tasks; however, they must still be able to intervene

##### Level 4:
Driver can safely divert all attention away from driving tasks and let the automated system take full control. This functionality is currently limited to specific “geofenced” areas and other relatively controlled environments1

##### Level 5:
No human intervention is required

Our current level is two.

In 2017, Audi invented their own system called "Audi AI". This system is integrated to latest A8. Today's car like Tesla required to do safety checks. This requires gripping the steering wheels. However this Audi A8 doesn't require frequent gripping. This is claimed to be first production car to reach level 3. This is possible because they added laser scanner to cameras and ultrasonic sensors which manufacturer never integrated to their systems before.

There isn't any individual who created this systems nor the groups. This is competition between many companies that there could be ideas that caused by Self-Driving Cars that we never aware of.
