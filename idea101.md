# Self-Driving Cars

The concepts of the Self-Driving Cars goes back to exhibition at 1939 New York World's Fair. General Motors displayed how World would be looks like in 20 years. Although it wasn't Self-Driving Cars on regular street, it was more like Self-Driving Cars on specially made track for Self-Driving Cars.

In 1977 Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory developed automated car.  It was simple idea. Putting the camera each side of cars (total two camera) and tracks white street markers and used computer to process the signal. But speed of cars only goes up to 19 miles per hour. However, after decade later, using Germans improved camera, it improved speed of the car up to 56 miles per hour.

There is different type of levels for the Self-Driving Cars.

Current market cars are level two.

In 2017, Audi invented their own system called "Audi AI". This system is integrated to latest A8. Today's car like Tesla required to do safety checks. This requires gripping the steering wheels. However this Audi A8 doesn't require frequent gripping. This is claimed to be first production car to reach level 3. This is possible because they added laser scanner to cameras and ultrasonic sensors which manufacturer never integrated to their systems before.

The A.I is depends on the data. More data is used to deep learn the A.I, the more accurate the A.I is. The data plays very basic, but major role at the future. The money we use today depends on the gold. Gold is most valuable object in the Earth and the form never changes. So gold is independant system, and dollar system depends on gold system. Like this, data wanted to play independant system. However, data changes the form over time. It corrupt as time passes. Although there is A.I data recovering system, but system that is creating A.I also depends on another A.I.

My art piece is about visual representation of corrupted data, and in perfect A.I recovered data.
