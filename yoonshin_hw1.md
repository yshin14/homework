##  **Idea No.19: The Emoticon**

_**What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons?**_



_**What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? Support your answer with references beyond the book.**_

The most common way to describes difference between these two is that emoticon is made out of letters, numbers, punctuation, symbols that creates certain describable symbols or faces that means certain meanings. Emoticon is in ASCII code that could be written. But Emoji is pictograph that not the letters, so it's not in ASCII.

##  **Idea No.24: The JPEG**

_**Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means. List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.**_

The JPEG is compressed. The compressed mean is that it doesn't contain additional information beyond to unable to recover to original file. Since JPEG have to be uploaded (photos) on internet and size is limited, basically losing information intentionally and having less file size. The GIF is lossless, it could recover back to original file since it is uncompressed.

##  **Idea No.45: Metadata**

_**List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book.**_

Metadata is basically behind the scene data (mostly hidden) that describes the data/file. Mostly contains title, time, date, GPS, author/copyright/creator, and keywords. Example in reality, in photo, if we take pictures in RAW file, it contains copyright, GPS(If camera have GPS), date, time, camera setting (Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO), histogram, white balance, and dynamic range.
