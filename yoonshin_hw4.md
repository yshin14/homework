# Foveon
The Foveon Sensor. This sensor is invented to be used in camera. This sensor is
innovative compare to commonly used CCD or CMOS censor. The CCD or CMOS uses grid pixel to record color data. The size of two by two pixels contains one red pixel, one blue pixel, and two green pixel. (Pattern varies by company) The other hand, this Foveon contains all RGB pixels in on pixel using 3 layer after layer. Before Foveon was invented, to take well color reproduced picture, camera literally had to take three pictures, one pixel to left, down, and right which it covers all RGB pixels (Since there is two green pixel and pattern varies, some pixel could miss some data.) But taking three pictures takes times, and if object moves during that time, no reason taking that photo. Foveon sensor could do this in one picture since it contains all RGB pixels. But this isn't in production yet, because it has down fall. Since there is three layer of RGB, photography(Drawing by light) uses light, but light that touches Red pixel and blue pixel is different, which could create tilted color correction.

# Mass Supply of 3D Printer.
Later close future, when the 3D printer is mass supplied to us like today's printer, possibly items on amazon isn't physically sends you the object but file that you can print and use it. But I do have different perspective. 3D printer also a computer, which changes digital input and output to actual output in real life. Which security is also big thing. What if a person with impure intent go through the security and able to print that possibly cause harm to people? Bomb, toxic gas vapor anything could possible if 3D printer have right material.

# Fourth Industrial Revolution
This was my big interest last couple years. Fourth Industrial Revolution is due to reality converted into computer data. The first question comes into my mind, "The Value of Human Labor Force". The beginning of human life, the labor force of human was very important. Everything is done by labor force of human. The first industrial revolution is steam engine/machinary revolution, second revolution is electricity/mass production revolution, and third industrial revolution is computer/web based information share revolution. The fourth industrial revolution will going to be AI/Big Data. Today, the moving physical object requires enormous amount of energy. Therefore human labor force is required to create something. Now if all the physical object is changed into computer data, and computer printed (3D Print)and object have similar quality as original, than scarcity of object disappear and new kind of economy evolves.Now human's labor force is replaced with AI, than now human cannot maintain their life cycle with existing labor force before. Production rate is sky rocketing than ever before, and people loses their work. Now all the Production that is created due to production, who is buying that? Since we don't work anymore and AI/Robots doesn't spend. Now capitalism could collapse.

# Self-Driving Car
The Self-Driving Car is also interesting idea. Not only car could drive itself, change in architecture and economic structure. The soon as self-driving car is in production, there is no more taxi. Uber, Lyft and taxi will be disappear. Just one example I mentioned, just changed economic structure due to self-driving car. Architecture will change to. Soon nobody owns the car. There is no more parking space is required because the self-driving car will be front of you soon as you contact the car. Now you have all these unused area. In those space we could farm using LED light (Plant can photosynthesis through LED light). So agriculture rate increases.
