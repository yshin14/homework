# Yoon Shin Hw Week 5

## Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?

Photography is invented to document reality. It had transition from drawing where artist had to be trained and time took. Invention of photography advanced documenting reality. From then, the color wasn't perfect. Color was always off due to white balance. White balance is measured in Kelvin. Our eye automatically find most white color in our view and adjust white balance to make color more accurate. In DSLR, this is emulated but it isn't perfect. This is due to grid system in sensor.

Each pixel keeps the one of RGB color data. Which this create pattern like picture at the bottom.

Today's sensor have 21~24mega pixel. (5616 pixels horizontal, 3744 pixels vertical. 2:3 Ratio) This is kind of problem. Our eye isn't pixel. We read all RGB at once. So this create bias in picture color science. High resolution camera (about 50mega pixel), one of their solution was taking three pictures moving one pixel each side. Not efficient when each picture cost 100mb and three of them will cost 300mb in simple math. This is where Foveon sensor kicks in. Foveon sensor is invented and advancing technology to keep all RGB data in one pixel. Color have different wavelength. Using this they invented new type of sensor.

Since light have to go through all three layers, it has poor strength on low light situation. Now they are trying to solve this issue, and I am wondering when this sensor will be used.

## Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.

Foveon X3 sensor is designed by Foveon, Inc. (Part of Sigma Corporation). The sensor is manufactured by Dongbu Electronics. This technology first produced as a test unit at 2002 for the Sigma SD9 DSLR camera. Sigma is third party lens company. Mainly for Canon DSLR, but now also Sony Mirrorless cameras. They originally lens making company for cameras. If they able to create this sensor and manufacture, than this company will change entire buissness and be one of best camera manufacturer.

## What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?

First color accuracy is almost 100% when they are able to solve lighting problem. Which brings photographer to decrease editing time. In my personal case, I take about 1500 pictures a day. This will take few hours to adjust every pictures color and white balance. Also more people possibly will get into photography more because you don't have to have good knowledge of color adjusting.
